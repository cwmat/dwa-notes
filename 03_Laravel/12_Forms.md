To demonstrate forms, lets create a form to add a new book in Foobooks.

The following form code should display when you visit `/books/create`:

```html
<form method='POST' action='/books/create'>
    <input type='hidden' name='_token' value='{{ csrf_token() }}'>
    <input type='text' name='title'>
    <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
</form>
```

The above form will submit to `/books/create` via the `POST` method.

To accept this submission, we have a route that looks like this:

```php
Route::post('/books/create', 'BookController@postCreate');
```

...which right now just has this code:

```php
/**
 * Responds to requests to POST /books/create
 */
public function postCreate() {
    return 'Process adding new book'.$_POST['title'];
}
```


## CSRF Protection in Laravel
The above form includes this line:

```html
<input type='hidden' name='_token' value='{{ csrf_token() }}'>
```

Which will translate to something like this in your HTML;

```html
<input type='hidden' name='_token' value='Qw7HOT2zXe1ouFUuNov73baXFZTz4nHdf0CyJvZe'>
```

This line is necessary when submitting forms with `POST` (or `PUT` or `DELETE`) because it helps prevent CSRF attacks (explained below).

If you don't have the CSRF token in your form, you'll get a `TokenMismatchException` error when trying to submit your form using the `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` methods.

CSRF protection in Laravel is an example of [__Middleware__](http://laravel.com/docs/middleware#terminable-middleware):

> &ldquo;HTTP middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware will redirect the user to the login screen. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application.

> Of course, additional middleware can be written to perform a variety of tasks besides authentication. A CORS middleware might be responsible for adding the proper headers to all responses leaving your application. A logging middleware might log all incoming requests to your application.

> There are several middleware included in the Laravel framework, including middleware for maintenance, authentication, CSRF protection, and more. All of these middleware are located in the app/Http/Middleware directory.&rdquo;




## What is CSRF?
CSRF, or __Cross-Site Request Forgery__, is a type of web application vulnerability where a user unintentionally runs a script in their browser that takes advantage of their logged in status on a target site.

For example, imagine you set up a route so that when users go to `http://yourdomain.com/users/delete` it will delete their account.

You've implemented proper JavaScript checking that confirms with the user they wish to delete their account before ever triggering the `/users/delete` method.

However, a hacker has dug through your source code to find this URL and wishes to trick your users into deleting their accounts.

To accomplish this, they could present the victim with an image (in a forum post, in a email, etc.) with the delete URL set as the image src, which would execute `http://yourdomain.com/users/delete`:

```html
<img src='http://yourdomain.com/users/delete'>
```

Alternatively, they could trick you into clicking on a link leading directly to the delete page:

```html
<a href='http://yourdomain.com/users/delete'>Free stuff!</a>
```

For another scary example, consider the following URL:

```txt
http://bankofamerica.com/withdraw?account=Victim&amount=1000000&for=Hacker
```

To prevent CSRF attacks you want to verify that the origin of requests on your site are coming from within your site. This is done by sending a unique, encrypted token with each form submission, the CSRF token.

When the form submission is received by your application, Laravel automatically checks the token to make sure it's valid, thereby verifying the form submissions is legitimate.




## Excluding from CSRF checking
There may be instances where you want to bypass CSRF checking. This can be done by adding specific URLs to the `$except` array in `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCSRFToken.php`, for example:

```php
protected $except = [
    'books/create',
];
```




## Methods other than POST and GET
In addition to POST and GET, there are three other HTTP methods you might wish to use, especially if you're using [RESTful routing](http://laravel.com/docs/controllers#restful-resource-controllers):
`PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. These latter methods are not actually available in HTML forms, but Laravel has [Form Method Spoofing](http://laravel.com/docs/routing#form-method-spoofing) which lets you mimic send via these methods. To do this, use the `method_field()` helper method:

```html
<form action='/books/create'>
    {!! method_field('PUT') !!}
    <input type='hidden' name='_token' value='{{ csrf_token() }}'>
    <input type='text' name='title'>
    <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
</form>
```

This will add a hidden field to your form, used to indicate to Laravel what method you're using:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT">
```




## Accessing form data using the Request class
As mentioned above, when we submit this form it submits to the `postCreate` method in `BookController`:

```
/**
 * Responds to requests to POST /books/create
 */
public function postCreate() {
    return 'Process adding new book'.$_POST['title'];
}
```

Up until this point, we retrieved data from the form using PHP's superglobal `$_POST`. This works, but there's a better/more sophisticated way...

In Laravel, request information is made available via a `Request` class. To use the `Request` class, start by adding this `use` statement at the top of your Controller:
`use Illuminate\Http\Request;`.

Example in the `BookController.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class BookController extends Controller {

[...]

```

Next, you need to make the `Request` object available to the method/action in which you want to use it, which in this case is `postCreate`:

So this line...
```php
public function postCreate() {
```

Becomes this:

```php
public function postCreate(Request $request) {
```

Once you do that, you'll have access to the `$request` object, and that can replace `$_POST`:

```php
/**
 * Responds to requests to POST /books/create
 */
public function postCreate(Request $request) {
    $title = $request->input('title');
    return 'Process adding new book: '.$title;
}
```

This practice of passing `Request $request` to the postCreate method is an example of __dependency injection__.

Dependency injection is a programming practice that lets you provide (i.e. inject) class dependencies on a method by method basis. The benefit of doing this is you can easily swap out different dependencies or &ldquo;mock&rdquo; dependencies for testing purposes.

Once you've passed the Request object to your method, you'll be able to access data from your forms like so:

```php
$title = $request->input('title');
```

This is essentially the equivalent of:
```
$title = $_POST['title'];
```

The difference is the Request class comes with not only all the data of your form, but additional information about the request, and methods you can perform on the request.



## Laravel Collective: Forms & HTML
Laravel 4 included a `Form` helper that included lots of helpers to generate form tags. This feature was removed in Laravel 5, but a group of developers have maintained the feature as a 3rd-party package making it possible to add it back. If interested, you can learn more about this package here: [Laravel Collective: Forms & HTML](http://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.1/html).
