A framework is a package of code.

Included in this package is a bunch of **libraries** which power the essentials of application development, for example:

* Routing
* Environment management
* Database interaction
* User authentication
* etc.

With all this taken care of, it frees you up to start building the functionality of *your* application.

In addition to this, a framework provides a **skeleton** in which to build your application.

Many PHP frameworks follow the **MVC Pattern**:

**Benefits of working with a framework:**

* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Work with tried and tested code.
* Write code that is more universally understood.
