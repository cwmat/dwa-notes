## List all the books
`books/index.blade.php` is created, just needs to be filled in.

Use the `Book` model to get all the books.
Pass this data to the View.

```php
public function getIndex() {
    $books = \App\Book::all();
    return view('books.index')->with('books',$books);
}
```

Display the data in the View by looping through it.
```php
@extends('layouts.master')

@section('title')
    All the books
@stop

@section('content')
    <div class='book'>
        @foreach($books as $book)
            <h2>{{ $book->title }}</h2>
            <img src='{{ $book->cover }}'>
        @endforeach
    </div>
@stop
```




## Make /books the homepage as well
```php
Route::get('/', 'BookController@getIndex');
```




## Add a book
`books/create.blade.php` has been updated to include all the fields:
+ author
+ published
+ cover
+ purchase_link

Note the use of `old()` and default values in the view.

In the controller, validate the new fields:

```php
'author'        => 'required|min:5',
'published'     => 'required|min:4',
'cover'         => 'required|url',
'purchase_link' => 'required|url',
```

Finish BookController.php `postCreate()` so the book is actually added to the database.

```php
$book = new \App\Book();
$book->title = $request->title;
$book->author = $request->author;
$book->published = $request->published;
$book->cover = $request->cover;
$book->purchase_link = $request->purchase_link;
$book->save();
```

If we keep refreshing the post page, it keeps adding new books. Solve with a redirect.

So far most of our controller methods have been returning Strings or Views.
You can also return a [redirect](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/responses#redirects).

Redirect to a confirmation page...

Or some other logical place like `/books` to view all books.

```php
return redirect('/books');
```

If you do the latter, you will want to [Flash](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/session#flash-data) a confirmation message.

Before redirecting:
```
\Session::flash('flash_message','Your book was added');
```

Then in `master.blade.php`:

```php
@if(Session::get('flash_message') != null))
    <div class='flash_message'>{{ Session::get('flash_message') }}</div>
@endif
```




## Mass Assignment for creating a book
Controller update:
```php
$data = $request->only('title','author','published','cover','cover_link');
$book = new \App\Book($data);
$book->save();
```

Model update:
```
protected $fillable = ['title', 'author', 'published', 'cover', 'purchase_link'];
```




## Edit a book
Fill in `getEdit($id)` method:
```
$book = \App\Book::find($id);
return view('books.edit')->with('book',$book);
```

`books/edit.blade.php` already exists, and expects `$book`.

Values need to be filled in using `$book`.

Add hidden field to store the `id`.

Test it with 1,2,3, etc.

Add links from /books.

Handle a bad id:
```php
if(is_null($book)) {
    \Session::flash('flash_message','Book not found');
    return redirect('/books');
}
```

Do the edit:
```php
$book = \App\Book::find($request->id);

$book->title = $request->title;
$book->author = $request->author;
$book->cover = $request->cover;
$book->published = $request->published;
$book->purchase_link = $request->purchase_link;

$book->save();

return 'Book was saved'.
```


Better return:
```php
\Session::flash('flash_message','Your changes were saved');
return redirect('/books/edit/'.$request->id);
```


## Delete a book
Try this one on your own.
