## File-level configuration
Add the following code to the top of your display page (before the doctype).

~~~php
<?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);       # Report Errors, Warnings, and Notices
ini_set('display_errors', 1); # Display errors on page (instead of a log file)
?>
~~~

If you've added the above code and you're not getting any error feedback (i.e. you run your script and you just see a blank white screen),
it means you have a *parse error* in the file that is preventing the file from being parsed ([ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16933606/error-reportinge-all-does-not-produce-error)). Because the file isn't completing parsing, it never even processes your error reporting code.

You can also enable PHP errors on the server, that way error reporting is turned on, regardless of whether your script can parse the error reporting setting or not.


## Server-level configuration

At the top of your page add the `phpinfo();` function to get a list of your current server configurations.

~~~php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
~~~

From the resulting table, we're interested in the following:

* The location of your `php.ini` file. Example:
	* MAMP on Mac: `/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.14/conf/php.ini`
	* XAMPP on PC: `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`

* What your `display_errors` configuration is set to.
* What your `error_reporting` configuration is set to.

To adjust these settings, track down the `php.ini` file and change `display_errors` to be `on` and `error_reporting` to be `E_ALL`.

**To make these changes take effect, restart your server**.

### Error

*You are doing something so wrong the script will terminate.*

~~~php
echo "foo
echo "bar";
~~~

### Warning

*You are doing something wrong and it is very likely to cause errors in the future, so please fix it.*

~~~php
fopen('this-file-does-not-exist.txt');
~~~

### Notice

*You probably shouldn't be doing what you're doing, but I'll let you do it anyway.*

~~~php
echo $foobar;
~~~


On a **development / local server** it's suggested you have **all levels** of errors reported.

On a **production / live server** it's best practices to **suppress all** errors.
