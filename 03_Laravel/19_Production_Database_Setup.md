With the topic of __migrations__ and __seeding__ behind us, the next logical step is to set up the production database.

Here is a summary of the steps we'll take (all on the production server) to get this done:

1. Make sure your production code is up to date
2. Find your default MySQL password.
3. Create a new database.
4. Set up these credentials in your production `.env` file
5. Run migrations (to build tables) and seeders (to fill tables)




## 1. Make sure your production code is up to date
Before proceeding with the next steps, the first thing you want to do is make sure any database related changes in your local code base have been added, committed, and pushed to Github, then pulled down to your production server.

Specifically, you want to make sure any __migration files__ and any __seeder files__ are in existence and up to date on your production server. The last step in this document will be to run these migrations and seeders, so we want to make sure they're ready to go.

So, do a `git status` locally. Are there any new or changed migration or seeder files? If so, go ahead and sync up so your live server also has these changes.



## 2. Find your default MySQL password

When you first SSH into your DigitalOcean server, you should see a welcome message (a.k.a &ldquo;[message of the day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motd_(Unix)&rdquo;). This message contains your MySQL root password, so take note and copy it to a secure location.

## 3. Create a new database
When working locally, we create new databases using phpMyAdmin. phpMyAdmin is not installed on your DigitalOcean server by default, so we'll instead use the MySQL command line tool to create a new database.

While SSH'd into your DigitalOcean server, run the following command to start the MySQL command line tool:

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

When it prompts for your password, use the MySQL password you copied in the previous step.

If all goes well, you should see some info about MySQL, followed by the `mysql> ` prompt.

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-mysql-tool-on-digital-ocean@2x.png' style='max-width:617px; width:100%' alt=''>



Run the `SHOW DATABASES;` command to see what databases exist on your server (there should be 3 default ones). Don't forget that every SQL Command has to end with a semi-colon.

```bash
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Create the database for your application using the `CREATE DATABASE <db-name>` command:

```bash
mysql> CREATE DATABASE foobooks;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

You can run `SHOW DATABASES;` again to confirm the new database exists.

When done, run `exit;` to get out of the MySQL command line tool.




## 4. Set up these credentials in your production `.env` file
In order for your application to interact with this database, you have to update your production `.env` file with the correct database credentials.

While SSHd into your DigitalOcean server, open your project's `.env` file in nano.

For example:

```bash
$ cd /var/www/html/foobooks/
$ nano .env
```

Your existing `DB` credentials will likely look something like this:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Update these settings, setting `DB_HOST` to be `localhost`, `DB_DATABASE` to be `foobooks` (or whatever your project database name is), `DB_USERNAME` to be `root`, and `DB_PASSWORD` to be the same MySQL password you used in the above step

Example after edits:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=foobooks
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

When you're done updating your values, save your changes and exit nano.

Now you want to test these credentials work.

If you still have the [/debug route](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2015-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/16_Local_Database_Setup.md#test-your-connection) from when you were configuring your local database connection, you can use that again to confirm your live database connection.

## 5. Run migrations (to build tables) and seeders (to fill tables)
The final step is to run your migrations on your live server to build your tables, then run your seeders to fill these tables with some sample data.

First, the migrations:
```
$ php artisan migrate
```

When you run this command, it will show you a warning, `Application In Production!` and ask you to confirm you wish to run the migration. Type `y` and hit `Enter` to confirm that you do.

Assuming your migrations successfully ran, you can now run your seeders:

```
$ php artisan db:seed
```

## Viewing your data
When working locally, to confirm your tables were built and data was entered, you loaded phpMyAdmin to open the `foobooks` database and examine the tables.

As mentioned above, though, we don't have phpMyAdmin on the DigitalOcean server. As a substitute, we'll use the MySQL command line tool again. The following commands should be all you need to cover the basics of examining tables.


Start the MySQL command line tool:
```
mysql -u root -p
```

Show all the databases that exist on the server:
```
SHOW DATABASES;
```

"Open" a particular database:
```
USE foobooks;
```

Show all the tables in a opened database:
```
SHOW TABLES;
```

Show all the rows in a table:
```
SELECT * FROM books;
```

If something goes wrong with your migrations or seeders and you want to &ldquo;start over&rdquo;, you could delete individual tables...

```
DROP TABLE migrations;
DROP TABLE books;
[...etc...]
```

Or, to delete all the tables at once, simply delete the entire database and recreate it:

```
DROP DATABASE foobooks;
CREATE DATABASE foobooks;
```


## Troubleshooting

### Access denied
If you try and run your migrations but they fail, it may be because the DB credentials you put into `.env` are incorrect. If that happens, you may see a message similar to this:

```
SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
```

If this happen, double check your credentials and try again.


### Class BooksTableSeeder does not exist
If you see a message telling you your seeder files does not exist, for example...

```
Class BooksTableSeeder does not exist
```

...try running `composer dump-autoload`. This will refresh the class list the the composer autoloader has, which can be a needed step when new classes are added.




## Tips

### phpMyAdmin on DigitalOcean
As mentioned above, phpMyAdmin does not come installed on DigitalOcean by default.

If you wish to install it, you can follow this tutorial: [DigitalOcean: How to Install and Secure phpMyAdmin](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-14-04).


### Changing your default MySQL password
The following command can be used to change the default MySQL password for `root`:

```sql
mysqladmin -u root -p'oldpassword' password newpassword
```

Note: If you change this password, you'll want to update what's in your `.env` file.


### mysql_secure_installation
When you SSH into DigitalOcean, you may have noticed a message prompting you to run the command `mysql_secure_installation`:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-encouraged-to-run-mysql-secure@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:827px; width:100%' alt='mysql_secure_installation'>

When you run the suggest command, `mysql_secure_installation`, you'll be prompted to make some setting changes that will make MySQL more secure.

[See the process here...](http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-mysql-secure-installation@2x.png)

[You can read more about mysql_secure_installation here...](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-secure-installation.html)


### Creating new MySQL users
In the instructions in these notes, we used a default MySQL user called `root`, which has full access to any database we have running in MySQL.

If you are running multiple applications/databases on the same server, it's more secure to create new MySQL users for each application/database. Those MySQL users should only have permissions to work with *their* given database. This way, if a hacker compromises the credentials for one of the MySQL users, that hacker won't have access to your other databases.

In the interest of time, and to reduce our room for error, we're not following this practice in this course. In a real world application, however, you should consider implementing this security best practice.
