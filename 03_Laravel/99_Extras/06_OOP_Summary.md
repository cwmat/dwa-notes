Object Oriented Programming (OOP) helps create clean, maintainable, reusable code.

OOP provides more organization and structure than *procedural programming* (*do this, then this, then this*).

The following is a quick summary of the OOP concepts that will help you better understand working with Laravel.

## Classes
OOP Starts with **Classes**.

A Class defines an entity of your project, for example a User.

Classes are composed of two things: **properties** and **methods**.

Example: *A User has characteristics (properties) and it can do these things (methods)*.

Outside the context of OOP, *properties* are essentially *variables*, and *methods* are essentially *functions*.





## Objects
From Classes comes **Objects**.

If a Class is a cookie-cutter, the Object is the cookie.

Syntax for creating a class:

```php
class User {

	// Properties

	// Methods

}
```

Syntax for instantiating (creating) a new Object from a Class:

```php
$user = new User();
```


## Properties

```php
class User {

	// Properties
	public $name;
	public $email;
	public $logged_in = false;

	// Methods

}
```

+ Prefix with the keyword `public`, `private`, or `protected`
	+ **public** : property is accessible inside and outside the object
	+ **private** : property is only accessible inside the object
	+ **protected** : property is accessible inside the object and any objects which inherit this object
+ In PHP, declaring properties in your Class is optional - but it's good practice.
+ You can assign simple defaults to properties (ex: `15`, `false`, `foobar`), but you can not assign expressions (ex: `15 - 5`, `$foo * 2`).




## Methods

A method is just a function that belongs to a class/object.

Most Classes will start off with getter/setter methods that allow access to the Class properties.

```php
class User {

	// Properties
	public $name;
	public $email;
	public $logged_in = false;

	// Methods
	public function getName() {
		return $this->name;
	}
	public function setName($new_name) {
		$this->name = $new_name;
	}

}
```

+ Using getters/setters demonstrates **encapsulation**; they make it so outside code can't interact with your object's data without that object having full control.
+ `$this` is a built-in variable that is a reference to the current object's methods and properties.
+ `public` is an example of an **access modifier** which controls where an object's method can be accessed from.
+ Access modifier options:
	 + **public** : method is accessible inside and outside the object
	 + **private** : method is only accessible inside the object
	 + **protected** : method is accessible inside the object and any objects which inherit this object
	 + **static** : no object instantiation is needed; can be called directly on the class. This modifier can be added in addition to the `public`, `private` or `protected` modifiers. For example, you can say: `public static foobar() {}` to declare that a method is both `static` *and* `public`.


## Magic Methods

Classes can contain [PHP magic methods](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php), which are predefined methods that have built-in functionality.

For example, your class can have a `__construct()` magic method. What makes this method &ldquo;magical&rdquo; is that it will automatially be called whenever you instantiate a new object of your class.

```php
class User {

	// Properties
	public $name;
	public $email;
	public $logged_in = false;


	// Methods

	function __construct() {
		echo 'You just created a new user!';
	}

	public function getName() {
		return $this->name;
	}
	public function setName($new_name) {
		$this->name = $new_name;
	}

}
```

Usage example:

```php
# This would output 'You just created a new user!';
$user = new User();
```

Given this, if you have statements that you want executed *everytime* a class is instantiated, put those statements in the construct method.
